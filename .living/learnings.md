## 2026-03-04: Evaluation Infrastructure Build

**Tags**: [pydantic, asyncio, dependencies, testing]

**What happened**: While implementing the evaluation infrastructure, multiple challenges emerged:
1. Adding required fields (precision, f1, hallucinated_titles) to the CitationScore Pydantic model broke all existing test fixtures that construct that model
2. Pyright couldn't narrow types from asyncio.gather results when using return_exceptions=True and index-based assignment
3. The textstat dependency was needed for Flesch-Kincaid grade level calculations but wasn't in pyproject.toml
4. rapidfuzz was already declared in dependencies but had never been actively used in the codebase until citation matching

**Lesson**:
- Always update test fixtures when adding required fields to Pydantic models — changes are not backward compatible
- When using asyncio.gather with return_exceptions=True, rely on isinstance checks against concrete types rather than index-based assignment for better type safety
- Review existing dependency declarations before adding new features — check if needed packages are already available
- Keep dependencies synchronized with actual code usage to avoid silent dead imports

## 2026-03-16: Depth Feature Implementation

**Tags**: [prompt-engineering, pydantic, pipeline-design]

**What happened**: Implemented 3-level depth control across the writing pipeline. Key observations:
1. Prompt builders in this codebase use f-string returns, not parts-list assembly — reviewers initially assumed parts-list pattern
2. EvidenceMap.evidence_chains stores serialized dicts (list[Any]), not typed objects — allocator must use dict access
3. Pipeline calls write_all_sections(), not write_section() directly — depth must flow through both
4. outline_critique_loop in critique/revision.py needed depth forwarding to both initial and revision generation paths

**Lesson**:
- Always read the actual function body before assuming a code pattern (f-string vs parts list)
- When threading a parameter through a pipeline, trace the FULL call chain — not just the function you are modifying
- Frozen dataclasses with dict fields allow dict mutation — consider MappingProxyType if true immutability needed
